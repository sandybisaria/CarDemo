Each car should have its own directory for its files. Give the car a short
(three letter) name.

Inside the car directory, create three subdirectories: "mesh", "sim", and
"textures". The mesh folder contains all the Ogre meshes, the sim folder
contains the .car file, and the textures folder contains the car textures. Refer
to the Stuntrally wiki for more info regarding how to create and format the
various files (http://stuntrally.tuxfamily.org/wiki/doku.php?id=features)

Any data files that are shared across cars (tire/suspension characteristics,
etc.) should go into the common folder.
